                        This is a habit tracker. 
                        It has date navigation where you can go to past or future habits. 
                        You can add habits on a particular day, and then you can click to 
                        mark that you have finished this habit today. 
                        In the coming days, you will also get this habit, 
                        so that you can check this habit every day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Interestingly, in past days, it doesn't show the habits that you create 
                        for today. Because the habit is created today, 
                        you cannot possibly have done it before.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For this application, I have two MongoDB collections. 
                        One for the habits and one for each time the habit is completed. 
                        So I can keep track of the completion separately.
