        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Sarah! I live in Seattle. Now I am pursuing a master degress in NEU. 
            I choose the Align CS program because it corresponds to my interests and goals.        
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Two main reasons drive me into the computer science world. 
            The first reason is my interest in computer science. 
            I got my Ph.D. degree at Peking University in 2020, 
            majoring in enterprise management. 
            From my Ph.D. research experiences, I realized our world is so profoundly 
            benefited from computer science, and we could achieve unlimited with it. 
            I am fascinated by such kind of advanced techniques, and I wish to learn more.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second reason is that I do not want to be far from my family. 
            I got married to my husband this year in 2020. 
            He works as a software engineer in Seattle. 
            I think this kind of transfer is right as I can still take advantage of my Ph.D. 
            experience and learn more technical skills.
        </p>
